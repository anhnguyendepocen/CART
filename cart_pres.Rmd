## What are Classification and Regression Trees?

They are basically _decision trees_ that make predictions based on binary splits. 

**Classification trees** predict a classification (categorical response). 

**Regression trees** predict means or medians (continuous response).

They are non-parametric in nature in that they don't involve p-values.

## How to read the trees

Start at top:  
- go left if condition is true  
- otherwise go right  

Repeat process until reaching a _terminal node_, or _leaf_. The value in the leaf is the predicted value.

Hence decision trees are easily interpreted by non-experts.
